</ul>

    <li>Can work with them to review a busy schedule and figure out how to balance school with extracurriculars or a part-time job</li>
    <li>Can help you get started with a daunting task, if you're not sure where to start (e.g. start studying for a big midterm, or start working on an important essay assignment)</li>
    <li>And so much more! Where the appointment goes is up to you, and your specific questions and needs. </li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens when you email to book an appointment? </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Email <a href='mailto:learning@uwo.ca'>learning@uwo.ca</a> </li>

        <li>The Consent Form</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Here's a sample email template:</h3>

<p>Hello, <br><br>

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [your full name], student number [your student number]. I would like to book an intake appointment with the Learning Development and Success Centre. I have attached the Assessment Form, Procedures and Guidelines Form, and the Consent form to this email. I am available Mondays from 9am-11am, Wednesdays 11am-1pm, and Fridays 1pm-3pm. [these are example time slots, change to fit your availability]<br><br>

Thanks, <br>
[your name]
</p>
<br>

<ul>
    <li>To book future appointments, email <a href='mailto:learning@uwo.ca'>learning@uwo.ca</a></li>
    <ul id='second'>
        <li>In the email, make sure to include your full name, student number, and preferably a list of time slots you'd be available in the next two weeks (Monday through Friday, 9am-4pm EST).</li>
        <li>This makes booking appointments easier and faster, so you can be scheduled in before someone else fills up that slot. Two weeks is ideal, because during busy periods, there might not be enough appointments available in the span of one week. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Here's a sample email template:</h3>    

<p>Hello, <br><br>

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [your full name], student number [your student number]. I would like to book an appointment with a learning counsellor please, and I've already had an intake appointment. Here's a list of time slots I'm available: [list of times you're available in the upcoming week]. <br><br>

[additional: if you would like to discuss mental health concerns, you could add this] If possible, could I meet with a learning counsellor who has a background in mental health counselling, and over a phone call instead of Zoom? <br><br>

Thank you,<br>
[your name]
</p>

<br>
<ul>
    <li>NOTE: if you are a returning student who has used the service before, you will need to fill out a consent form relating to video appointments, which can be found here: https://www.uwo.ca/sdc/learning/Support/individual_counselling.html </li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens when you call?</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bring:</strong> It might be a good idea to bring notes on the topics you'd like to discuss, or make a list of specific questions you'd like answered, but this is not required! Also, if you are meeting over Zoom call and you'd like to screenshare a calendar or schedule, it might be easier to have those open beforehand. </li>
    <li><strong>Phone call:</strong> If over phone call, wait for them to call first, since they do not provide you with phone numbers. They will call you at the time of your appointment (though don't worry if they're 2-3 minutes late, that happens sometimes); They also usually call from a “No Caller ID” Number</li>
    <li><strong>Zoom call:</strong> If over Zoom, join the Zoom link that has been sent to you when it reaches the time of your scheduled appointment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Strategies for meetings</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Sample question to ask: [insert description of specific problem you're encountering] - what are some strategies you can recommend for handling [issue1] and [issue2]? </li>
    <li>If you don't get the help you're looking for (for example, a counsellor says that your question is something you should ask Accessibility Services or Psychological Services), you could ask them how to get in touch with those other services. </li>
    <li>(It is very likely that they will tell you this information without being prompted, since they very often recommend different resources around campus, but this is a good question to write down just in case) t</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens after that first meeting?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If during that first meeting, you discussed certain resources with a counsellor, they will send a follow-up email later with links to websites or pdfs of various tools or templates </li>
    <li>You can book appointments with Learning Development and Success again, if you'd like more support afterwards. This can be done either through:</li>
    <ul id='second'>
        <li>Emailing the main learning@uwo.ca email, where Cori will help you schedule an appointment with a counsellor</li>
        <li>Emailing the counsellor you met with directly, at their own Western email address</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Will you meet with the same person again?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Yes, you will typically meet with the same counsellor again when you book another appointment, unless they are not available or you request to meet with a different counsellor. It can be very convenient to meet with the same person again, since they already know you and your situation. </li>
    <li>Although even if you don't meet with the same person again, the counsellor from a previous session will have taken notes on what was discussed during the meeting, so the new counsellor will have an idea of the context of your situation</li>
</ul>

<h2>What else can they support you with afterwards?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If you try their strategies for a few weeks and they don't work very well for you and your learning style, or perhaps they work for a while but stop working for some reason, you can book another appointment with them to brainstorm some different strategies. </li>
</ul>
