<h2>Overview of the Service</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Western Health & Wellness offers free, non-crisis mental health support services to all Western students.</li>
    <li>Students can call 519-661-3030 to set up an appointment with a trained counsellor, who they can meet with via video call (Zoom) or phone call. </li>
    <li><strong>Website: </strong><a href='https://www.uwo.ca/health/psych/book_an_appointment.html'>Click here</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>What kinds of services do they offer?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Primarily focused on short-term psychotherapy, with the goal of working with students to find concrete strategies that they can use to improve their mental well-being.</li>
    <li>You can ask your counsellor about referrals to psychiatrists and other community mental health services.</li>
    <li>Counsellors can also direct students to other Western services (i.e. Learning Development and Success, Accessible Education, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens when you call to book an appointment?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bring: Your Student ID, health card, and calendar/schedule</li>
    <li>You will first reach an automatic answering machine and will be directed to indicate if you’re interested in booking, rescheduling, or cancelling an appointment.</li>
    <li>If you select “book an appointment”, you will speak with a staff member who will ask about your availability. They will also request your Student ID number, and your health card number. </li>
    <li>After the call, you will receive an email confirming your booking, and you will be required to fill out forms regarding confidentiality and what you hope to get out of your meeting. </li>
        <ul id='second'>
            <li>The first form is a general confidentiality form which outlines the scope of residence counselling services and confirms that you understand their parameters (i.e. not a crisis service)</li>
            <li>The second form is specific to your meeting and will be shared with your counsellor: in it, you will be asked to outline how you’re feeling, what you’re struggling with and what you think Psychological Services may be able to help you with at your meeting.</li>
        </ul>
    
</ul>

<h2>Ways that they can help / Strategies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Know what you want to get out of the meeting before going into it: make a list of your specific questions, concerns, etc. </li>
    <li>Ask your counsellor about other support services that may be beneficial</li>
</ul>

<h2>What happens afterwards?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You can reach out via the same phone call method to book further appointments.</li>
    <li>You can request the same counsellor, or a different counsellor. </li>
</ul>
